      <h2>What Stops Most People</h2>

    <h3>How Do I Start?</h3>
      <p>First and foremost, you are going to need a routine otherwise known as a split. Essentially a split is just a routine that you follow. You will workout different muscle groups on different days and then repeat. That is a split. What split should I do? Don't worry we have you covered. One of the best basic begginer splits is Push, Pull, Legs. Push is including any pushing motions for example benchpress, you are pushing the bar away from you. These muscle groups include Chest, Shoulders, and Triceps. Pull inlcudes anything pulling toward you, such as pull ups. These muscle groups include Back and Biceps. Lastly is pretty self explanatory, Legs. </p>
